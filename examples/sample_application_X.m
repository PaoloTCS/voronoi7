# Project Proposal: Semantic Analyzer

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to build a tool for analyzing semantic content.
The core idea is to use embeddings.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Preprocessing
Input text will be cleaned. Sentences will be tokenized.
Stop words might be removed depending on the strategy.

### 2.2 Embedding Generation
We will use pre-trained sentence-transformer models.
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
sentences = ["This is an example", "Embeddings are amazing"]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
