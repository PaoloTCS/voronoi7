What's Next? Options:
Before diving into the significantly more complex Phase 3 (Super Tokens & Lossless Path Encoding), there are a few valuable intermediate steps we could take:

Testing and Refinement: Thoroughly test the existing functionality. Run 
streamlit run app.py, load samples, chunk, embed, visualize both levels, test KNN for both levels. 
Does everything work as expected? Are there UI glitches or errors?

Implement Real Document Loading: Replace the "Load Sample Documents" placeholder with actual file uploading (st.file_uploader) and processing logic (potentially using pypdf2 for PDFs, which we added to requirements.txt).

Implement Semantic Chunking: Replace the placeholder logic in _chunk_by_semantic_similarity with the actual sentence embedding similarity algorithm we discussed. This would make the fallback mechanism functional.

Implement Basic Simplex Analysis: Add functionality to the visualization plots (maybe on click) to select 3 (or 4) points and calculate/display the barycentric coordinates and basic semantic interpretation of the centroid, bridging towards the "interior analysis" goal.
Start Phase 3 (Super Tokens): Begin implementing the lossless path encoding service (gmpy2-based) and the basic SuperToken model, as outlined in the plan. This is a big step involving BigInt math and graph concepts.
Recommendation:

I would strongly recommend Options 1, 2, and 3 before tackling Phase 3 or 4:
Testing (1) ensures the foundation is solid.
Real Document Loading (2) makes the app practically usable.
Semantic Chunking (3) completes the core logic of Phase 2, giving you truly context-aware chunks.
Implementing these would create a very capable "Version 1" of your chunking and analysis tool, providing a solid base before adding the more advanced path encoding and super token layers.
How would you like to proceed?
Focus on testing and debugging the current state?
Implement actual document uploading?
Implement the semantic chunking logic?
