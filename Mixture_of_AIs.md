This is where I wat to head in this session

# Help from GPT 4.1
I've reviewed your notes in CLAUDE.md from "## Q and A from claude.ai chat session" to the end. Here’s a summary and review of the direction you outlined:

Semantic Triangulation Concept:

You want to connect documents in your tessellated domain/subdomain structure using a semantic metric.
The significance of triangle interiors in 2D semantic space is that each point inside represents a weighted mixture of the three vertex documents, potentially revealing "missing" documents or semantic gaps.
Proposed Implementation (from Claude):

Introduce classes like SemanticTriangle and SemanticTessellation to model and analyze these relationships.
Use barycentric coordinates to interpret interior points as weighted combinations (set operations) of document features.
Suggests using Delaunay triangulation on document embeddings for tessellation.
Integration Recommendations:

Create a new directory (e.g., app/semantic/) for semantic analysis logic.
Add new files for triangle logic, tessellation management, and set operation interpretation.
Integrate with your document model for embedding generation.
Add API endpoints for semantic triangulation.
Extend the UI to visualize semantic triangles and their interiors, possibly with heatmaps or interactive exploration.
UI/UX Suggestions:

Allow users to explore triangle interiors, see "heat maps" of semantic density, and suggest missing documents.
Make semantics a first-class concept in your app, with the ability to switch or overlay domain and semantic tessellations.
Next Steps:
If you want to proceed, I can help you:

Plan the new backend and frontend files/components.
Scaffold the semantic analysis logic in your current project structure.
Advise on integration points with your existing document and visualization logic.
Let me know which part you’d like to start with, or if you want a concrete implementation plan for the backend, frontend, or both.
